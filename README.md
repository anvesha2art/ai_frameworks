# 1. JOJO AI Assistant
**Key Features:**
1) User Friendly: I added a microphone input for a more hands free conversation, option to upload images and files from the device. I updated the AI internal instruction to make jojo's responses full of colourful emojis.
2) Deep customisation: I developed a reboot theme system that allows users to change the colour scheme and select fun unique doodle watermark for the chart background. I insured the chosen theme and doodle are saved even when the user closes and reopens the app. 
3) Accessibility and Interaction: I implemented a text to speech feature for JOJO to read the answer, a regenerate option for instant new answers and the edit option for user to fix the prompt even after submitting it.

# 2. Gurukul School Management

# 3. RankRadar AI
**Key Features:**
1) Multi Exam Toggling: I created a system with a dedicated toggle button for JEE, NEET, CLAT and CUET, allowing users to switch models easily, making it an all in one platform.
2) Accurate Prediction: I design the AI prompt to factor in marks, percentile, gender and caste for better rank prediction. This was crucial for achieving the real time accuracy for the Indian admission process. 
3) College recommendation: I insured the AI not only predicted the rank but also suggested the colleges and branch, the user is likely to get into, turning the rank predictor into a valuable counselling tool. 
4) Colour Theme: I assigned a specific appealing colour theme to each exam toggle, making the app visually appealing.

# 4. Flappy Bird
**Key Features:**
1) Game Store: I added collectible coins and life keys during gameplay, a fully functional store with options for skin, accessories and background, all purchasable with collected coins. This transformed the sample game into a much more engaging product with long term retention goal. 
2) Dynamic audio: I added custom hooks using web audio API to generate a custom background music loop melody and unique sound effects for jumping, collecting and crashing.
3) Cinematic Visuals: I introduced a parallax background effect where distant clouds move slower than near objects giving the game a sense of depth and speed. The cinematic and dynamic field making the visual much more appealing.
4) Revive mechanics: I implemented the ability to use collected life coins after a crash for an instant revive.
